/*
Some things I would like to see in the calendar:
• scheduled shifts
• open shifts
• events:
    -family that might be out of town
    -carers that will be unavailable to take on shifts
    -doctor's appointments
• could see a rough overview of the day? click on day to get a more detailed view
• the calendar should show who is scheduled to cover each shift. anyone with access to the calendar should
    be able to see that.
